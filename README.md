## Interactive workplace design in VR

Course: Virtual and Augmented Reality under Prof. Andrew Johnson at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

## Project Description

The first project assigned to us was developing a immersive environment. For this purpose, our Professor, Andy provided us the layout of our classroom and our task was to convert the classroom into an ideal office room. This task provided us with the first-hand experience of using the Unity3D software and VIVE.

## Application Developed

The basic model of an ideal office was developed. At the entrance, there is a reception desk and a waiting room for the clients of the company. The waiting room has sofa, coffee table and a table with a few glasses of water. Also there is a door for restroom.  

The main work area is separated from the waiting area. This area consists of cubical where up to four employees can work. This area is accompanied by a table and beanbags where important meetings or discussions can be done. Moreover, this area has a food section which consists of a display table and refrigerator. The scene also has objects such as bookshelf, wall-painting, dustbin, standing lamps, etc. which provides a realistic office experience.  

Following is the list of movable objects (objects that can be grabbed from one location and placed/thrown at different locations) in the scene –  

1. EVL Mug  
2. Flower Vase  
3. Glasses of Water  
4. Paper Stack  
5. Water Purifier  
6. Cereal Box  

Light Control - The application allows the user to have a moderate control over the lights. The functionality provided here is via a Light Switch Board. The Switch Board is located near the “Exit” Door. As soon as the person moves in the vicinity of the Switch, it enables the person to “Switch On / Off” the light of the Standing Lamp.  

Audio Sound - A music is clearly audible while the person is in the waiting area. The source of the music is the speaker which is mounted near the restroom door. The intensity of the audio fades as the person moves away from the speaker.

The audio file used for this purpose is a song called “Spectre” by Alan Walker which is a NoCopyrightSound(NCS) release, i.e., the song can be used for game-development as well as other purposes. The Youtube link for the song is Alan Walker – Spectre (NCS Release).
